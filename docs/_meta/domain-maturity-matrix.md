## Phase 2 Maturation Targets

Domains at Tier 1 or below must reach Tier 2 by 2026-10-31. Priority order:

### Industry Domains (0 at Tier 1)

> Group A (datacenter, food, semicon, cosmetics) promoted to Tier 2 on 2026-08-07 — see matrix rows above.
> Group B (battery, biotech, defense, logistics) promoted to Tier 2 on 2026-08-07 — 2 industry-unique workflows + 1 skill + 1 EM each; `legal_basis` compliance-verified via live MCP (kr_safety + legalize_kr).
> Group C (railway, shipbuilding, steelmaking, waste) promoted to Tier 2 on 2026-08-07 — 2 industry-unique workflows + 1 skill + 1 EM each; `legal_basis` compliance-verified via live MCP; HPGSCA Art 14/17/28→11/13/15/24/26 remediation + waste CCA Art 23 citation fix.

**All 12 Phase-2 target industries (Groups A + B + C) now at Tier 2.** No industry domains remain at Tier 1.

### Functional Domains (6 at Tier 1 or below)

1. **training** -- already has 8 workflows, 5 EMs, 52 agent lines; needs only +1 Skill to reach Tier 2
2. **incident-investigation** -- 5 workflows, 3 EMs; needs +1 Skill, +2 EMs, +50 Agent lines (no agent file)
3. **risk-assessment** -- 5 workflows, 2 EMs; needs +1 Skill, +3 EMs, +50 Agent lines (no agent file)
4. **asset-integrity** -- 4 workflows, 2 EMs; needs +1 Workflow, +1 Skill, +3 EMs, +50 Agent lines (no agent file)
5. **contractor-safety** -- 1 workflow, 1 EM; needs +4 Workflows, +1 Skill, +4 EMs, +50 Agent lines (no agent file)
6. **occupational-health** -- 1 workflow, 1 EM; needs +4 Workflows, +1 Skill, +4 EMs, +50 Agent lines (no agent file)

### Near-Tier 3 Domains (Quick Wins)

These domains are at Tier 2 and need only a single metric boost to reach Tier 3:

1. **ehschem** -- needs +1 EM (has 6, needs 7)
2. **msds** -- needs +1 EM (has 6, needs 7)
3. **meddevice** -- needs +1 Skill (has 1, needs 2)

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Tier 3 (Mature) | 9 domains |
| Tier 2 (Operational) | 15 domains |
| Tier 1 (Scaffolded) | 4 domains |
| Tier 0 (Placeholder) | 2 domains |
| **Total** | **30 domains** |

### Tier Distribution

- **Industry domains**: 8 Tier 3, 14 Tier 2, 0 Tier 1, 0 Tier 0
- **Functional domains**: 1 Tier 3, 1 Tier 2, 4 Tier 1, 2 Tier 0

> 2026-08-07 -- Group A maturation: datacenter, food, semicon, cosmetics promoted Tier 1 -> Tier 2 (1 skill + parallel EM additions each).
> 2026-08-07 -- Group B maturation: battery, biotech, defense, logistics promoted Tier 1 -> Tier 2 (2 industry-unique workflows + 1 skill + 1 EM each; compliance-verified via live MCP).
> 2026-08-07 -- Group C maturation: railway, shipbuilding, steelmaking, waste promoted Tier 1 -> Tier 2 (2 industry-unique workflows + 1 skill + 1 EM each; compliance-verified via live MCP; HPGSCA + waste-CCA citation remediation). All 12 Phase-2 industries now Tier 2.
