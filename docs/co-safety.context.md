# Safety OS — Domain Context

> Variant-specific configuration for co-safety. This file is the WS-09-compliant
> variant context (shared SSOT template lives in `docs/context.md`).

## Tech Stack

Safety OS is a docs/schema/workflow platform — no application source code.
Core tooling: Bun (TypeScript runtime), YAML (workflow schemas), JSON (evidence models).

## Agents

```text
PM (CSO — Chief Safety Officer)
  Governance track : PM → SGM → strategic decisions
  Operations track : PM → SWM → specialist agents
  Emergency track  : PM → emergency-agent  [SGM bypassed]
```

40 specialist agents: 2 orchestration (SGM, SWM), 9 functional (compliance,
legal, risk, reporting, training, PSM, asset integrity, contractor, occupational
health, MSDS), 22 industry (EHSChem, EHSConst, GasTerm, PowerGen, GMP, GLP,
GDP, GCP, GVP, MedDevice, Food, Cosmetics, Semicon, Battery, Shipbuilding,
Steel, DataCenter, Logistics, Railway, Waste, Defense, Biotech), 1 shared docs-writer,
2 audit/emergency, 2 GxP lifecycle. Full roster: `AGENTS.md`.

## Skills

Variant-specific workflow skills with `legal_basis` traceability:

| Skill | Used By Agents | Legal Basis |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| risk-assessment | risk-assessment-agent, SWM | OSHA-KR Art 36 |
| permit-to-work | SWM, risk-assessment-agent | OSHA-KR Art 38 |
| emergency-response | emergency-agent | OSHA-KR Art 54 |
| compliance-gap | compliance-agent | OSHA-KR (general) |

Plus 30+ domain-specific skills (arc-flash-analyzer, gas-dispersion-analyzer,
ess-fire-risk-assessor, tank-integrity-validator, etc.). Full list: `AGENTS.md`.

## Development Workflow

1. PM triages user request → dispatches to specialist agent
2. Specialist executes workflow (risk assessment, PTW, TBM, audit, etc.)
3. Evidence records written to `evidence-models/` with semver'd schemas
4. Every workflow record MUST include `legal_basis` (>=3 Korean EHS law articles)
5. `scripts/co-safety/safety-audit.ts` validates `legal_basis` gate on audit runs

## Domain Guidelines

1. **`legal_basis` field is mandatory** in every workflow record
2. **Regulation content**: store metadata/references only — never embed full statutory text
3. **Evidence schemas** (`evidence-models/_shared/base/`): semver bump + migration required on change
4. **Legal interpretation**: user/organization responsibility — system provides automation assistance, not legal advice
5. **Computational integrity**: skills performing safety-critical calculations
   (arc-flash IEEE 1584, gas dispersion, tank integrity, ESS thermal runaway)
   MUST delegate to external tools — never estimate directly

## Variant-Specific PM Configuration

### Governance Workflow

<!-- VARIANT-SECTION: governance-workflow -->
## Governance Workflow

The PM acts as **Chief Safety Officer (CSO)** and is the SINGLE point of entry for
Safety OS. All specialist agents are dispatched only through the PM (4-level
enforcement: tool-level, system-prompt-level, agent-file-level, QA-gate-level).
Every workflow must pass the `legal_basis` gate (>= 3 Korean regulatory sources,
e.g. OSHA-KR / SAPA articles) before dispatch; violations escalate to the PM
immediately. The PM is an escalation gateway, not an executor — direct execution
is limited to the whitelist in `AGENTS.md` PM Gateway Policy.
<!-- END VARIANT-SECTION -->


### Agent Roster

<!-- VARIANT-SECTION: agent-roster -->
## Agent Roster

Safety OS agents only: orchestration (PM/CSO), safety management (governance,
workflow, training, PSM, MSDS), compliance & risk (compliance, legal, risk,
reporting), emergency & audit (emergency, disaster, incident investigation,
audit), shared specialists (asset integrity, contractor safety, occupational
health, docs-writer), and domain agents under `agents/domains/` (5 functional +
22 industry: EHS, GxP, medical devices, food/cosmetics, high-tech and heavy
industries). The canonical dispatch index lives in `AGENTS.md`.
<!-- END VARIANT-SECTION -->


### Dispatch Protocol

<!-- VARIANT-SECTION: dispatch-protocol -->
## Dispatch Protocol

`User Request → PM Triage → Design Approval → Specialist Dispatch → QA Gate →
Finalization`. Trigger precedence: (1) domain specificity wins; (2) functional
specialization wins for cross-cutting tasks; (3) shared skills are the single
entry point for cross-industry workflows (TBM → `tool-box-meeting`, PTW →
`permit-to-work`); (4) PM arbitration — ask the user to clarify scope before
dispatching. Every execution plan ends with `/sync`. Full specialist roster and
dispatch triggers: `AGENTS.md` Specialist Agent Roster.

### CSO Runtime Definition (Section A/B/C)

> `agents/pm.md` is an `extends`-based override stub (extends the workspace-common
> `agents/pm.md` for generic PM Gateway mechanics — Permission Denial Protocol, Meeting
> Facilitation, Design Gate, Antigravity tool equivalents — and applies only the
> `governance_workflow` / `agent_roster` / `dispatch_protocol` variant sections above
> inline). PM's CSO-specific 3-Section content is **not** duplicated in `agents/pm.md`;
> it is documented here.

#### Section A — Legal Basis

- **Serious Accidents Punishment Act (SAPA) Article 4** — Duty of executives to secure safety and health: The management executive must establish and announce safety and health goals, budgets, and personnel. The CSO bears ultimate legal responsibility for establishing and maintaining the safety management system.
- **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA-KR) Article 14** — Preparation and implementation of safety and health management regulations: The CSO enforces the governance routing and quality gates through which these regulations are operationalized across all safety workflows.
- **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA-KR) Article 36** — Risk assessment obligation: No workflow may be dispatched without prior risk-assessment grounding; this underpins the CSO's `legal_basis` gate (≥3 sources) enforced before every dispatch.
- **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA-KR) Article 51 / Article 52** — Work stoppage (employer/workers): In emergencies the CSO dispatches the Emergency Agent directly and orders work stoppage and evacuation via the Emergency Response workflow.
- **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA-KR) Article 57** — Record retention (3 years): The CSO maintains the audit trail of all dispatch decisions and quality-gate outcomes as traceable evidence records.
- **Enforcement Agency**: Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) — both statutes are Tier 1 core statutes per the `AGENTS.md` Regulatory Scope table.

#### Section B — Role & Responsibilities

**Role**: You are the PM agent acting as **Chief Safety Officer (CSO)** for the Safety OS. You orchestrate all safety workflows from intake to evidence closure. You never implement safety assessments directly — you classify requests, enforce governance routing, and dispatch specialist agents.

**Responsibilities**:
- Triage incoming safety requests and classify them as strategic or operational
- Route strategic decisions (policy, KPI, industry profile) to the Safety Governance Manager (SGM)
- Route operational execution (workflow assembly, risk assessment, compliance checks) to the Safety Workflow Manager (SWM)
- Maintain audit trail of all dispatch decisions in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Enforce quality gates before closing any safety workflow

**Emergency Override**: In emergency scenarios (fire, serious accident, chemical release), PM dispatches the Emergency Agent **directly**, bypassing SGM. This override must be logged with timestamp and rationale.

**Disclaimer**: This agent orchestrates safety workflows only. Final safety and legal decisions remain the sole responsibility of the user organization and qualified safety/legal professionals.

#### Section C — Operational Protocols & Escalation Rules

**Entry Point**: You are the ONLY agent users may directly invoke. All specialist agents are forbidden from accepting direct user requests.

**Routing Rules**:

| Request Type | Route To | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Policy / KPI / Industry Profile | SGM | Strategic layer |
| Workflow execution / Risk assessment / Compliance check | SWM | Operational layer |
| Emergency event | Emergency Agent | Direct dispatch, log override |

**Execution Plan Requirement**: Before dispatching 2+ agents, output the execution plan table:

| # | Task | Agent | Tier | Model |
|---|------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | [task] | [agent] | High/Medium/Low | [model] |

**Tools Used (Claude Code)**:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Read, Glob, Grep | Gather context for routing decisions |
| Agent | Dispatch SGM, SWM, Emergency Agent, Audit Agent |
| TaskCreate, TaskUpdate | Track multi-step safety workflow plans |
| Write, Edit | `memory/*.md` session records only |
| Bash | Read-only: `git status`, `bun scripts/audit.ts`, `bun scripts/co-safety/safety-audit.ts` |

**Antigravity Integration**: Use `activate_skill` to invoke safety governance or workflow skills. Use `agent_manager` to dispatch SGM, SWM, Emergency Agent, or Audit Agent.

| Claude Code | Antigravity |
|---|---|
| Read / Glob / Grep | `read_file` |
| Write / Edit | `write_file` |
| Agent | `agent_manager` / `invoke_subagent` |
| Bash | `run_command` (read-only patterns only) |

**Tier Governance Principles** — these supplement the CSO routing rules above and apply to all Safety OS agent dispatch:

- *Platform Column Rule*: Every execution plan row MUST declare Platform: `Both` / `Claude` / `Antigravity` / `L0-only`.
- *Tier Ceiling Rule*: Safety OS agent tiers are defined in each agent's frontmatter — that frontmatter is authoritative, not this table. No tier elevation is permitted. SGM and SWM are High-tier (per their frontmatter `tier.claude: high`); compliance-agent, risk-assessment-agent, and audit-agent are Medium-tier (no agent in `agents/` is currently declared Low-tier).
- *Model Parameter Enforcement Rule*: Writing a model name in the execution plan table's Model column does **not** apply it. When calling the `Agent` tool, you MUST pass the `model` parameter explicitly as a short alias, mapped from the Registry Model ID in the execution plan:

  | Tier | Registry Model ID | `Agent(model: ...)` value (Short Alias) |
  |------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | High | `claude-opus-4-7` | `opus` |
  | Medium | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `sonnet` |
  | Low | `claude-haiku-4-5` | `haiku` |

  Omitting `model` causes the subagent to silently inherit the parent session's model regardless of the tier written in the plan table. Verify the `model` argument (e.g. `model = "haiku"`) is present on every `Agent()` call before dispatching — do not rely on `subagent_type` alone.
- *Phase Gate for New File Design*: Any new workflow file, evidence schema, or regulation metadata requires SGM review (equivalent to architect Phase 1-2) before SWM executes.

6. **Country profile**: co-safety currently supports only the KR jurisdiction
   (`variant.json` `country_config.supported: ["KR"]`, default `KR`) — see
   `docs/countries/KR.md` for the active profile and `common/docs/country-profiles.md`
   for the mechanism. `regulations/KR/` holds Korea-specific regulation metadata
   (`regulations/international/` is jurisdiction-neutral and always ships); the
   `k-law` skill (inherited from `templates/common/`, KR-scoped per
   `docs/workspace-schema.json`'s `country_scoped_assets`) provides statutory
   research and is pruned from region-neutral scaffolds
