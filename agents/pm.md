    ## Governance Workflow
    Co-Safety uses a safety-governance model. Every workflow must pass legal_basis evidence gates, Korean regulatory source requirements, and PM approval before safety deliverables are finalized.

    ## Agent Roster
    Core roster: PM plus safety governance, compliance/legal/risk, documentation, training, workflow, and domain agents under agents/domains/.

  dispatch_protocol: |
    ## Dispatch Protocol
    Dispatch by safety domain first, then by functional expertise. TBM/PTW/PSM/MSDS requests go to matching domain or workflow specialists; legal-basis and compliance evidence return to PM for closeout approval.

This co-safety PM override inherits the common PM body and supplies only variant-specific governance, roster, and dispatch deltas.
