    ## Governance Workflow

    The PM acts as **Chief Safety Officer (CSO)** and is the SINGLE point of entry for
    Safety OS. All specialist agents are dispatched only through the PM (4-level
    enforcement: tool-level, system-prompt-level, agent-file-level, QA-gate-level).
    Every workflow must pass the `legal_basis` gate (>= 3 Korean regulatory sources,
    e.g. OSHA-KR / SAPA articles) before dispatch; violations escalate to the PM
    immediately. The PM is an escalation gateway, not an executor — direct execution
    is limited to the whitelist in `AGENTS.md` PM Gateway Policy.

    <!-- VARIANT-SECTION: agent-roster -->
    ## Agent Roster

    Safety OS agents only: orchestration (PM/CSO), safety management (governance,
    workflow, training, PSM, MSDS), compliance & risk (compliance, legal, risk,
    reporting), emergency & audit (emergency, disaster, incident investigation,
    audit), shared specialists (asset integrity, contractor safety, occupational
    health, docs-writer), and domain agents under `agents/domains/` (5 functional +
    22 industry: EHS, GxP, medical devices, food/cosmetics, high-tech and heavy
    industries). The canonical dispatch index lives in `AGENTS.md`.

  dispatch_protocol: |
    <!-- VARIANT-SECTION: dispatch-protocol -->
    ## Dispatch Protocol

    `User Request → PM Triage → Design Approval → Specialist Dispatch → QA Gate →
    Finalization`. Trigger precedence: (1) domain specificity wins; (2) functional
    specialization wins for cross-cutting tasks; (3) shared skills are the single
    entry point for cross-industry workflows (TBM → `tool-box-meeting`, PTW →
    `permit-to-work`); (4) PM arbitration — ask the user to clarify scope before
    dispatching. Every execution plan ends with `/sync`. Full specialist roster and
    dispatch triggers: `AGENTS.md` Specialist Agent Roster.
