# Asset Integrity Check Skill

## Overview
This skill manages the scheduling, execution, and documentation of asset integrity and mechanical reliability checks to prevent catastrophic equipment failures.

## Operational Steps
1. **Schedule Review**: Identify upcoming mandatory inspections for critical equipment (e.g., pressure vessels, piping, relief valves).
2. **Work Order Generation**: Create inspection work orders specifying the required testing methods (e.g., NDT, visual).
3. **Coordinate with Maintenance**: Interface with maintenance teams or external contractors to execute the checks.
4. **Data Entry & Analysis**: Record inspection results and compare against established acceptance criteria.
5. **Deficiency Management**: Trigger immediate corrective actions or risk assessments if assets fall outside safe operating limits.
6. **Record Retention**: Archive inspection reports for PSM and regulatory audit traceability.
