# Risk Assessment

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when a user reports a new work task, equipment change, workplace modification, or requests a formal hazard identification and risk scoring exercise. Also use when onboarding new workers to a worksite or updating existing risk registers.

## Steps

1. **Scope Definition** — Identify the workplace unit, work task, and affected personnel. Confirm the assessment period and responsible person.
2. **Hazard Enumeration** — List all identified hazards (physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, psychosocial) associated with the task or area.
3. **Risk Scoring** — Score each hazard on two axes:
   - **Likelihood**: 1 (rare) to 5 (almost certain)
   - **Severity**: 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic)
   - **Risk Level** = Likelihood × Severity (1–25 scale)
4. **Control Assignment** — For each hazard, assign one or more controls following the hierarchy: Elimination → Substitution → Engineering → Administrative → PPE. Record responsible person and target completion date.
5. **Documentation** — Save the completed assessment record as structured JSON per `evidence-models/domains/functional/risk-assessment/risk-assessment-record.json` schema. Also save a human-readable summary to `memory/assessments/` with the `legal_basis` field populated. Obtain responsible person signature or digital acknowledgment.

## Output Format

Generate a structured JSON evidence record conforming to `risk-assessment-record.json` (OSHA-KR Article 36 evidence model) and save a human-readable summary to `memory/assessments/risk-assessment-YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md` with the following structure:

## Legal Notes

- Runtime records (structured JSON + human-readable summary) are written under `memory/assessments/` — never into `evidence-models/`, which holds schemas only. This mirrors the audit-agent FIND/CA precedent (`memory/findings/`, `memory/corrective-actions/`).
- Facility-level living risk registers are produced by rolling up RA instances via `bun scripts/risk-register-rollup.ts`; register rollups (`RR-*.json`) are written under `memory/registers/`.
- 산업안전보건법 제36조 requires employers to conduct risk assessments and implement control measures for all identified hazards.
- 중대재해처벌법 제4조 imposes enterprise-level obligation to establish and maintain safety management systems including risk assessment.
- 산업안전보건법 시행규칙 제37조 requires recording and preserving risk assessment results; 고용노동부 고시 「사업장 위험성평가에 관한 지침」 defines the risk assessment methodology, documentation requirements, and control hierarchy.
- Assessments must be reviewed when work methods change, after incidents, or at a minimum annually.
- Records must be retained for a minimum of 3 years per enforcement guidelines.
- This skill provides workflow assistance only and does not constitute legal advice.
