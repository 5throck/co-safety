// @version 1.43.0
// v1.43.0 (2026-09-23, adopt-project engine prerequisites — spec
//          2026-09-23-adopt-project-conversion): two safety patches that external-project
//          adoption depends on. (1) VARIANT-SCOPE SKILL PRUNE now honors the
//          v1.17.1 safety: a skill declared in the project's variant.json
//          skill_manifest.variant_specific is kept (an adoption run seeds the manifest
//          precisely so foreign-domain skills survive the registry prune; previously
//          this pass had NO manifest check and silently `git rm`-ed adopted skills).
//          (2) .gitattributes moves out of the blind LOCKED overwrite into
//          mergeGitattributes() — merge-aware delivery on the mergeGitleaksToml
//          (v1.10.0) pattern: project-only attribute lines (GitLFS trackers, custom
//          merge drivers, the scaffold-time `docs/context.md merge=ours` rule) survive
//          the template overwrite instead of being silently stripped on every upgrade.
// @version 1.42.0
// v1.42.0 (2026-09-22, T-20260922-001 follow-up): W2 HARVEST in CONTEXT_COMMONIZATION —
//           lines UNIQUE to the variant copy inside a removed near-duplicate section are
//           now computed (trimmed non-empty line set difference vs the matched common
//           section) and reported as backport candidates ("W2 HARVEST — backport
//           candidates" block + summary count) instead of being silently deleted with
//           the section. Informational only — the removal itself is unchanged
//           (behavior-additive; design NG1/NG2 revised, see
//           docs/designs/2026-09-10-context-purification-design.md addendum).
// v1.41.0 (2026-09-21, T-20260922-001): SKILLS_REGISTRY_RECONCILE now ADDS rows for
//           newly delivered skills (previously skipped — T-007 contract-skill delivery
//           needed a manual backfill across 11 projects) via helpers/skills-registry.ts
//           (shape-based parser handling ## Registry, duplicated headings, and
//           category-sectioned formats; emitted cells always unquoted).
// v1.40.0 (2026-09-21, ticket batch T-20260921-007/010/016/019): (1) CONTRACT
//           common_skills bypass the frozen variant.json allowlist gate + loud
//           CONTRACT PARITY report (T-007); (2) CORE-SCRIPT FORK arm — a
//           version-bumped fork of dev-sync.ts/audit.ts is restored to canonical
//           instead of printing OK forever (T-010); (3) post-upgrade sync-skills
//           timeout 30s → 120s with explicit partial-sync warning (T-016).
// v1.39.0 (2026-09-21, ticket batch T-20260921-001/006): (1) pre-upgrade stash
//           skips gracefully on repos with no initial commit (fresh scaffolds
//           could not receive any upgrade); (2) country prune scrubs AGENTS.md
//           skill-path lines and variant context mentions of pruned k-* skills
//           — region-neutral scaffolds no longer fail their own audit.
// v1.38.0 (2026-09-21, rollout hardening — 2026-09-21-upgrade-project-rollout-
//           hardening-design): (1) SKILLS_REGISTRY_RECONCILE moved after ALL
//           skill-mutating passes — it previously ran before the skills delivery,
//           reconciling pre-delivery state and guaranteeing registry drift on
//           every version-changing delivery (co-game/co-architect rollout
//           failures). (2) Variant-skills pass gains equal-version CATCH-UP/DRIFT
//           via the shared catchUpDir helper (company-intelligence terms-ko.json
//           incident). (3) Apply-mode writes .claude/last-upgrade-delivery.json
//           recording the delivered diff so project /sync can auto-apply E5.
// v1.37.1 (2026-09-21): CATCH-UP DRIFT paths are normalized to POSIX separators
//           before printing, so Windows runs report `references/x.md` not
//           `references\x.md` (cross-platform log parity + test assertions).
// v1.37.0 (2026-09-21, skill sub-file sync): the common-skills SYNC_IF_NEWER
//           pass delivered only skills/<name>/SKILL.md, so skill sub-files
//           (references/, assets/, examples/) never reached existing projects —
//           the 2026-09-20 handbook v0.6.0 fleet upgrade shipped SKILL.md while
//           KOREAN_LANGUAGE.md and the localized copy-code.js stayed absent
//           fleet-wide (8 emergency re-delivery PRs on 2026-09-21). NEW/UPDATE
//           now copy the whole skill directory via cpSync (template files
//           overwrite same-named files, project-only files are preserved), and
//           equal-version skills get additive catch-up: missing files are
//           delivered, same-version content differences are warned as DRIFT and
//           left untouched. Variant-skills copySkillDir is now recursive so
//           depth ≥ 3 files (references/validation/*) are delivered too.
// v1.36.0 (2026-09-20, E2E refinements to T-20260920-003): retired-mirror sweep
//           hardened — a project-authored skills/<name>/ SSOT (co-newbiz: 100+
//           standalone-track skills) now preserves its mirrors, and only names
//           with an explicit retirement marker (root lifecycle record retired/
//           deprecated, or mirror SKILL.md status) are pruned; project-authored
//           orphans without a retirement decision are kept for human review.
// v1.35.0 (2026-09-20, T-20260920-001/-002/-003): three hardening changes —
//           (1) DEPENDENCY GUARD pass: scan delivered scripts' bare-package
//           imports against project package.json and report missing packages
//           (report-only, lib/dependency-guard.ts; pm-md-parser/js-yaml fleet
//           incident). (2) agents/ SYNC_IF_NEWER gains equal-version content-
//           drift reconciliation mirroring the scripts pass v1.17.2 rule
//           (lifecycle-stripped comparison — T-20260920-002 i18n-specialist).
//           (3) --prune-removed: skills/ category consults L0 root skills/ as
//           upstream, and platform mirror dirs (.claude/.gemini/.agents/.codex
//           skills) whose name has no upstream source are pruned as retired-
//           skill residue (T-20260920-003 validate-docs-links class).
// v1.34.0: --platform 'both' renamed to 'all' and expanded to cover all three
//          platforms (claude+antigravity+codex, not just the first two) —
//          added the missing `codex` value and a CODEX.md MERGE branch that
//          new-project.ts already had but this script never picked up.
// v1.33.0: ADR-0081 fleet sweep / T-20260919-003 — COMMON-CONTEXT block splice
//          under CONTEXT PRESERVE. When the wholesale docs/context.md copy is
//          skipped (project-only top-level sections) the template's
//          COMMON-CONTEXT managed block is now spliced into the preserved copy
//          (spliceCommonContextBlock, helpers/context-sections.ts v1.5.0), so
//          managed-zone policy content (e.g. the ADR-0080 authority section)
//          delivers without --force-context-sync. Project-only sections and
//          everything outside the managed block stay untouched. Dry-run logs
//          the splice without writing.
// v1.32.0: T-20260917-010 — pre-reconcile recovery snapshots. When the merge
//          lib reports replaced unlabeled span(s) (result.snapshots), the
//          wrapper writes them to `<target>.pre-reconcile.bak` BEFORE the
//          merged content lands and logs the SNAPSHOT line; a snapshot write
//          failure aborts fail-closed before that file's destructive
//          reconcile. Dry-run never writes. Design:
//          docs/designs/2026-09-17-governance-backlog-batch-design.md.
// v1.31.0: T-20260916-012 — managed-block merge extraction + keyed-block
//          destruction fix (design docs/designs/2026-09-16-managed-block-merge-fix-design.md):
//          the merge core moved to the new pure lib/managed-block-merge.ts
//          (mergeManagedBlocks; this file keeps only fs concerns) because
//          mergeWorkspaceManaged's unlabeled-blocks reconciliation phase had
//          two compounding defects: (1) projOccurrences counted ALL pattern
//          matches — keyed WORKSPACE-MANAGED/VARIANT-INJECT blocks included —
//          against a template count of UNLABELED blocks only, so a project
//          file whose only managed blocks were keyed (real case: co-develop
//          .gitignore / AGENTS.md, 2026-09-16) hit the count-mismatch branch
//          and the reconcile replaced the first-to-last span with an EMPTY
//          join — deleting the .gitignore secrets block (.env/*.pem; caught
//          only because the upgrade's own security gate failed) and AGENTS.md's
//          43-line graft block; (2) reconcile/positional offsets were captured
//          BEFORE the keyed replacements mutated the content, so legitimate
//          reconciles sliced stale positions. The lib tracks keyed and
//          unlabeled project occurrences separately, slices unlabeled spans
//          only, and re-scans unlabeled occurrences AFTER the keyed phase
//          (fresh offsets); zero-unlabeled-template reconciles still remove
//          stale unlabeled project blocks by design but can never touch keyed
//          blocks. All log lines unchanged (verbatim from the lib); COMMON-*
//          zones are key-less and byte-identical in behavior.
// v1.30.0: T-20260916-006 — upgrade-target realpath guard (H14, design
//          docs/designs/2026-09-16-upgrade-target-realpath-guard-design.md):
//          the target is canonicalized with fs.realpathSync AFTER the existsSync
//          pre-check (so the not-found error keeps firing first, unchanged, on
//          the lexical form), workspaceRoot and Projects/ are canonicalized once
//          at resolution time, and the root guard + containment check compare
//          canonical forms only — a symlink resolving to the workspace root now
//          hits the unchanged hard-fail root guard instead of slipping past
//          lexical comparison into the symlink-following existsSync/git checks.
//          The outside-Projects WARN gains a fail-closed confirm-prompt
//          (default N, precedent-style 'Proceed? [y/N]' from the
//          template-version.txt flow): it names the canonical target, fires for
//          dry-run too, and EOF/non-y answers abort with exit 1 (policy refusal,
//          not the optional-prompt exit 0); --yes stays the single scripted
//          consent token. No new flags.
// v1.29.0: T-20260916-010 — post-upgrade docs/VERSION_MANIFEST.md regeneration
//          (mirrors the skill-graph regeneration): the upgrade refreshed
//          agents/skills/scripts, so the project manifest is stale until the
//          next /sync — regenerate now via the project's own
//          scripts/generate-version-manifest.ts (cwd = projectDir, non-fatal
//          warn-and-continue). Also retires the stub-manifest class: variant
//          templates no longer ship docs/VERSION_MANIFEST.md and the file
//          joined lib/upgrade-policy.ts REGENERATED_FILES (never
//          template-delivered), so a project still carrying an old stub gets
//          a full generated manifest on its next upgrade instead.
// v1.28.0: Conflict-semantics + snapshot-honesty set (2026-09-15 project review,
//          docs/reports/2026-09-15-project-review-template-fleet.md). C2/H1: the
//          pre-upgrade stash now includes untracked files (git stash push -u) and
//          the locally-modified set is snapshotted BEFORE the stash runs, so
//          --dry-run's CONFLICT verdicts match apply instead of being silently
//          downgraded to UPDATE once the tree is stashed clean. M4: a failed
//          stash is a hard error (exit 1) — it previously masqueraded as "working
//          tree clean", leaving the upgrade without rollback coverage. H3:
//          --rollback exits 1 when the restore fails and is a no-op plan under
//          --dry-run. H2: --prune-removed falls back to a direct delete when
//          `git rm` fails on untracked files (sibling VARIANT-SCOPE SKILL PRUNE
//          pattern) and no longer counts failed prunes. M1: the script exits 1
//          when the security summary is FAILED instead of always exiting 0.
// v1.27.0: Root-target guard — a <project-path> that resolves to the workspace ROOT is
//           rejected with an error, and targets outside Projects/ print a warning. The
//           root passes both pre-flight guards (existsSync, git-repo check), and the
//           2026-09-12 root-upgrade incident (memory/2026-09-12.md) delivered the whole
//           template/L1 tree into the repo root through exactly this hole.
// v1.26.0: MANAGED_PATTERNS gains COMMON-CONTEXT (START/END) so the DOCS_MERGE
//           pass merges the common coding-guidelines zone in docs/<variant>.context.md
//           into project copies — previously projects had no delivery channel for
//           that zone (only scaffold-time copies carried it, and inconsistently).
// v1.25.0: docs/context.md project-only preservation in the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC SYNC branch —
//           a footer-bump overwrite used to clobber PROJECT-ONLY content with at most a
//           warning-only CONFLICT (and no warning at all when the copy was git-clean, which
//           every fleet project is). The SYNC branch now runs findProjectOnlySections()
//           (helpers/context-sections.ts v1.3.0) on the destination vs the incoming template:
//           project-only top-level sections (headings absent from the template, outside
//           COMMON-*/VARIANT-INJECT managed zones) or a missing version footer
//           (wholeFileOwned — fully restructured file) trigger CONTEXT PRESERVE — the copy
//           is SKIPPED with a loud per-section log — unless --force-context-sync is given,
//           in which case the overwrite proceeds and logs the discarded section count.
//           Files without project-only content keep the exact UPDATE/CONFLICT behavior;
//           dry-run produces the identical PRESERVE verdict.
// v1.24.0: graft fleet surface (ADR-0076, upgrade-policy v1.2.0) — the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC
//           pass gains an ADD_IF_MISSING branch (seed-only, PROCEDURES semantics) so
//           .codex/config.toml seeds into projects without one while co-abap/co-safety's
//           project-owned Codex config is never touched. .mcp.json/opencode.json now
//           JSON_MERGE via the existing branch; .claude/skills/graft delivers via the
//           pass's SYNC policy (hand-maintained skill, outside sync-skills' SSOT).
// v1.23.1: mainline fixes (#894 design-gate seed delivery, #895 country provenance
//           fallback) integrated in this merge.
// v1.23.0: New ENV_SAMPLE SYNC pass — .env.sample is no longer PRESERVE. Scaffold-time
//           country pruning (prune-country-scoped-assets.ts) strips country-scoped env
//           blocks from the project copy, so a wholesale template re-copy would re-inject
//           them; the pass instead delivers the template content through the shared
//           lib/env-sample.ts with the project's detected country applied (region-neutral
//           = all blocks stripped), so template env-key additions reach existing projects
//           without resurrecting pruned country profiles. Delivery is a MERGE, not an
//           overwrite (the mergeGitleaksToml lesson, v1.10.0 — Projects/co-price carries 16
//           project-only keys): template re-delivered lines drop the project's byte-equal
//           boilerplate and supersede same-NAME keys (placeholder normalization), while
//           project-only keys, their section dividers, inline notes, and commented-out
//           documentation keys are preserved verbatim under a marker section. Idempotent;
//           standard conflict warning on locally-modified copies; --dry-run parity.
// v1.22.1: Data-loss fix in --prune-removed — the skills prune category consulted only
//           templates/common/skills, so variant-owned skills delivered by the VARIANT SKILLS
//           pass (e.g. co-abap's sap-*) were marked prunable for projects without a
//           variant.json manifest. The category now also accepts the variant template's
//           skills/ directory as a template source (identity-separated projects unaffected —
//           the missing dir is filtered out).
// v1.22.0: Folded VARIANT_DOCS_SYNC into the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC pass (Phase C of
//           2026-09-11-upgrade-policy-coverage-design.md) — the 5 hardcoded files are claimed
//           by the default SYNC policy with identical inline-version/hash/conflict semantics,
//           removing the last duplicated hardcoded docs list. No behavior change; the files
//           now report under "TEMPLATE TREE SYNC" and treeChanged instead of syncChanged.
// v1.21.0: New TEMPLATE TREE SYNC pass (2026-09-11-upgrade-policy-coverage-design.md) — upgrade
//           coverage used to be enumeration, so template files with no claiming pass were
//           silently never delivered to existing projects (most of the variant docs tree —
//           user-guide, handoff-spec, VERSION_MANIFEST, skill-graph.overrides.json, variant
//           domain docs, countries/KR.md — plus .github/, .claude|gemini/settings.json,
//           .editorconfig, skills.json). Classification moved to scripts/lib/upgrade-policy.ts
//           with the fallback policy SYNC (deliver by default): this pass delivers every file
//           whose claim names it — add-if-missing, then inline-version/hash update with the
//           standard conflict warning; WORKSPACE seeds (docs/designs, docs/lifecycle, …) are
//           add-if-missing only; platform settings.json are deep-merged with project-only
//           array entries preserved. GOVERNANCE_FILES gains SECURITY.md. New companion
//           scripts/check-upgrade-coverage.ts reports (and can gate) the classification matrix.
// v1.20.0: New CONTEXT_COMMONIZATION pass (after VARIANT_DOCS_SYNC) — near-duplicate
//           sections of docs/<variant>.context.md are pruned once the refreshed
//           docs/context.md supersedes them: token-overlap >= 0.65 → REMOVE (logged),
//           >= 0.30 → REVIEW (manual Context Commonization Review, ADR-0050 Part 3 —
//           never auto-removed), below → silent. COMMON-*/VARIANT-INJECT zones and the
//           version footer are excluded; sections containing managed-zone content are
//           never auto-removed. Honors --dry-run; opt-out via
//           --skip-context-commonization. Comparison reads the template source so
//           dry-run verdicts match apply. Thresholds tuned on the real fleet
//           (docs/designs/2026-09-10-context-purification-design.md D2).
// v1.19.2: --prune-removed preserves project-declared variant-owned agents/skills
//           from variant.json in common-only sync mode (identity-separated forks
//           such as co-architect have no templates/<variant>/ source directory).
// v1.19.0: Registry-row reconciliation fixes in reconcileScriptRegistry() — (1) fall back to the
//           templates/common/scripts/SCRIPTS.md registry when the L0 row misses (scripts shipped
//           from common under variant-prefixed upstream names, e.g. the handbook/ suite, were
//           silently never registered — verify-scripts "Unregistered script" ×26 on
//           co-abap-plugin/co-architect/co-price during the 2026-09-06 fleet resync); (2) rewrite
//           an appended row's layer cell from L0/L0-only → L3, since layer-L0 rows are skipped by
//           verify-scripts at project context while the file ships on disk (upgrade-project.ts
//           itself hit this); (3) drop stale duplicate rows for the same script during version
//           update instead of first-match-only replace (lifecycle-sync-audit Check A failures on
//           co-export dispatch* rows); (4) the row version written is the delivered template
//           file's own @version (L0's row can be newer than the L1 snapshot — writing L0's
//           number tripped lifecycle-sync-audit Check A).
// v1.19.1: VARIANT_DOCS_SYNC gains the co-develop privacy-design-checklist pair (EN+KO) —
//           generalized template-grade residue of the harness-assessment privacy ADRs.
// v1.17.0: Identity-separated fork support — a project whose variant.json self-declares a variant
//           with no templates/<variant>/ dir (e.g. co-architect from co-work) is accepted in
//           "common-only" sync mode: templates/common + project-owned files only, no readiness
//           gate against a nonexistent variant template, variant-template passes no-op.
// v1.17.2: Equal-version content-drift reconciliation — SYNC_IF_NEWER scripts pass now hashes
//           same-version files and restores the canonical L1 copy when content differs (drifted
//           local forks were invisible to version-gated sync forever).
// v1.17.1: Country-prune safety — a skill the project variant.json registers in
//           skill_manifest.variant_specific is kept (with a KEEP notice) even when the detected
//           country doesn't match its scope; manifest adoption beats country inference.
// v1.16.0: New project asset allowlist gate — SYNC_IF_NEWER add-if-missing of common skills/agents now
//           consults the project variant.json (skill_manifest.allowlist / agents[].file) and SKIPS
//           unregistered NEW assets instead of injecting them (0.6.0 i18n wave tripped audit-variant
//           allowlist/parity checks in 3 projects). Existing-file updates stay ungated; variant-skills
//           pass is exempt (variant template is the authority); projects without variant.json ungated.
// v1.15.0: New PROCEDURES SYNC pass — add-if-missing delivery of the variant workflow corpus (ADR-0063); legacy projects scaffolded before the procedures wave receive procedures/ entries with project-owned preservation.
// v1.13.0: New VARIANT-SCOPE SKILL PRUNE pass — a skill present in
//           templates/common/skills/ AND in exactly one templates/co-*/skills/ is a
//           variant-exclusive skill mistakenly duplicated into common; removed from
//           projects whose variant is not the owner (skills/ SSOT + platform mirrors).
//           Closes the sound-synth leak class (docs/designs/2026-08-28-skill-hygiene-
//           and-conventions-design.md).
// v1.12.0: New GOVERNANCE FILES SYNC pass — add-if-missing delivery of top-level
//           governance files (LICENSE) that fell through every other pass (the
//           LOCKED/MERGE/DOCS/SYNC passes are path-specific and VARIANT ASSET DIRS
//           SYNC only discovers directories). Source: variant template, then
//           templates/common. Strictly add-if-missing: an existing project file is
//           always preserved (licenses are intentionally forkable — co-price's
//           commercial appendix, co-safety's filled-in copyright line).
// v1.11.0: New VARIANT ASSET DIRS SYNC pass — generically discovers and hash-syncs any
//           top-level variant template directory not already covered by the existing
//           agents/skills/scripts/docs passes (e.g. co-safety's workflows/, regulations/,
//           evidence-models/, industry-profiles/). Previously such directories had no
//           upgrade path at all: a project scaffolded before the directory existed in the
//           template (or missing it from a promotion gap) never received it, and template
//           updates to that content never reached existing projects. New/changed files are
//           copied; project-only files are left alone (no deletion — that stays a manual or
//           future --prune-removed extension).
// v1.10.1: Country-profile awareness (ADR-0057/0058) on the UPGRADE path — previously
//           only the scaffold path (new-project.ts / create-l3-scaffold.ts) knew about
//           country-scoped assets, so:
//           (1) the skills/ SYNC_IF_NEWER pass re-injected k-dart/k-law/k-kosis into
//               region-neutral projects on every upgrade, undoing scaffold-time pruning
//               (prune-country-scoped-assets.ts). A registry-driven prune pass now runs
//               after ALL skill-copy passes, with an isLocallyModified() conflict guard
//               so a project that intentionally forked a scoped skill keeps its fork.
//           (2) the post-upgrade template-version.txt rewrite dropped the country= line,
//               erasing the project's country provenance; it is now preserved (or
//               country=none written, matching the region-neutral default posture).
// v1.10.0: Two gaps found while upgrading 7 real projects in one session:
//   (1) .gitleaks.toml moved out of blind LOCKED overwrite into mergeGitleaksToml() —
//         co-abap's project-specific allowlist entries (vendored-ABAP false-positive
//         exclusion, SAP trial default-credential regex) were silently dropped by the
//         old LOCKED behavior, breaking the pre-push secret scan on the next push.
//   (2) SYNC_IF_NEWER: scripts/ now calls reconcileScriptRegistry() after every copy —
//         previously file CONTENT was synced by version but the project's own
//         scripts/SCRIPTS.md registry was never updated, so verify-scripts.ts/
//         lifecycle-sync-audit.ts failed after every single upgrade (stale version
//         numbers on existing rows, "Unregistered script" for newly-added files) and
//         required manual reconciliation every time.
// upgrade-project.ts — Upgrade an existing project to the current template version
// Usage: bun scripts/upgrade-project.ts <project-path> [--variant <variant>] [--platform claude|antigravity|codex|all] [--dry-run] [--prune-removed] [--rollback] [--yes] [--skip-context-commonization] [--force-context-sync]
// v1.9.0: Moved docs/context.md from DOCS_MERGE (managed-block merge) to VARIANT_DOCS_SYNC
//           (version-footer sync) — the common template carries no managed-block markers,
//           so the merge path was a silent no-op despite the file's *context.md version: X.Y*
//           footer existing specifically for this comparison. VARIANT_DOCS_SYNC's src resolution
//           generalized from a variant-dir-only join() to resolveTemplate() (variant, then common)
//           to support docs/context.md's common-only SSOT.
// v1.3.0: Added multi-pattern managed block support (WORKSPACE-MANAGED, COMMON-CLAUDE, COMMON-GEMINI);
//           removed stale agent MERGE references and context.md
// v1.6.0: Added --prune-removed, --rollback, conflict detection for SYNC files, auto-discovery for script subdirs
// v1.7.0: Added DOCS_MERGE (variant/common docs), VARIANT_DOCS_SYNC, COMMANDS_SYNC;
//           extended managed block markers (VARIANT-INJECT, COMMON-AGENTS, DYNAMIC_SKILLS);
//           added sync-skills.ts post-invoke for platform skill distribution
// v1.8.0: extractScriptVersion now falls back to JSDoc `* @version` headers (files like
//           security-validator.ts were silently never synced); added variant scripts/skills
//           sync (templates/<variant>/scripts/<variant>/ and skills/<variant>/ → project);
//           agent overwrites preserve the project's local `lifecycle:` frontmatter block.
// v1.8.1: fix(mergeWorkspaceManaged): match managed blocks positionally (template's Nth
//           occurrence of a marker <-> project's Nth occurrence) instead of blindly
//           replacing every occurrence with each template block in turn — the latter
//           clobbered all N blocks with the last-processed block's content whenever a
//           single marker type (e.g. COMMON-CLAUDE) wraps multiple distinct sections.
//
// Migrated from upgrade-project.sh/ps1 per ADR-0036. No file permission manipulation.
