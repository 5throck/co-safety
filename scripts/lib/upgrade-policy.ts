//          docs/designs/2026-09-25-registry-policy-completeness-design.md
//          R4): `.agents/mcp.json` joins JSON_MERGE_FILES (design D6) — same
//          genus as root `.mcp.json` (ADR-0076 v1.2.0 precedent): pure JSON
//          carrying MCP server registrations a project may customize; the

//          protective for future ones. `.codex/config.toml` deliberately stays
//          ADD_IF_MISSING with the rationale documented at the claim site
//          (design D7).
// v1.15.0 (2026-09-25, T-20260924-003 — spec
//         docs/designs/2026-09-25-inventory-decisions-batch-design.md R2.4):

//         test the upgrade agents/ SYNC pass now uses to skip template stub
//         files (they resolve at scaffold/adopt time; delivering the 8-line
//         stub over a project's resolved body was the v1.35.0 drift-
//         reconciliation clobber proven on Projects/co-work agents/pm.md).
// v1.14.0 (2026-09-25, T-20260924-011 — spec
//         docs/designs/2026-09-25-codex-merge-claim-routing-design.md D2/D3/R3):
//         exports VARIANT_ASSET_DIRS_PASS (the pass id already returned for every
//         top-level dir outside KNOWN_TOP_DIRS) alongside TEMPLATE_TREE_SYNC_PASS,
//         and resolveClaim uses it at the fallback branch — upgrade-project's
//         VARIANT ASSET DIRS pass now filters every walked file by claim-pass
//         identity, ending the procedures/** inversion (the asset pass's
//         hash-sync overwrite contradicted the PROCEDURES pass's per-entry
//         add-if-missing ownership; the dedicated pass is the sole delivery
//         channel for procedure entries). No classification changed — only the
//         pass-id constant is new.
// v1.13.0 (2026-09-24, platform-parity P1 bug 4 — spec
//         docs/designs/2026-09-24-platform-parity-p1-bugfixes-design.md D4):
//         CODEX.md joins MERGE_MANAGED_FILES — resolveClaim returns
//         { policy: 'MERGE_MANAGED', pass: 'MERGE' }, so the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC
//         pass can no longer wholesale-overwrite a divergent project CODEX.md
//         (the destructive overwrite path is dead; the MERGE pass owns delivery).
// v1.12.0 (2026-09-24, scaffold identity overview — spec
//         2026-09-24-scaffold-identity-overview-design): docs/project.md claims
//         ADD_IF_MISSING on the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC pass (project-owned identity
//         seed — upgrade copies it only when absent, never overwrites); without
//         the explicit claim the deny-list fallback (SYNC) would wholesale-copy
//         the template seed over user content on every upgrade (the co-abap
//         docs/context.md regression class). docs/project.template.md joins
//         TEMPLATE_ONLY (scaffold-removed): new-project renders it into
//         docs/project.md and deletes the raw copy, so an upgrade must never
//         resurrect it. This claim MUST land in the same change set as the
//         docs/context.md 2.13 footer bump — the bump is what makes every
//         project's next upgrade walk the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC pass.
// v1.10.0 (2026-09-21, rollout hardening): isDeliveredDiff() — a changed-file list
//         is fully explained by a recorded upgrade delivery (delivered files ∪
//         pipeline artifacts) so dev-sync step 3.9 can auto-apply E5 (sync-only)
//         instead of blocking routine fleet resyncs.
// v1.8.0 (2026-09-17, T-20260917-009): SCAFFOLD_COMMON_OWNED_FILES exported —
//         new-project's variant-overlay skip and validate-templates WS-07 both
//         derive from this one classification instead of parallel hand lists.
// v1.7.0 (2026-09-17, T-20260917-001): MERGE_MANAGED_FILES exported so the
//         validate-templates managed-block-parity arm (PM-04) enforces
//         common→variant parity over the same file set upgrade MERGE unions.
// v1.6.0 (2026-09-16, T-20260916-010): docs/VERSION_MANIFEST.md joins
//         REGENERATED_FILES. Variant templates stopped shipping the stub
//         manifest (validate-templates `variant-version-manifest` arm retires
//         the stub class); the project manifest is generated state — produced
//         post-delivery by new-project.ts §7.8 and regenerated post-upgrade by
//         upgrade-project.ts. Without this reclassification the deny-list
//         default (TEMPLATE TREE SYNC / SYNC) would deliver any future
//         template copy over a project's generated manifest.
// v1.5.0 (2026-09-12, T-20260912-021): PLACEHOLDER_ALLOWLIST gains
//         skills/explain-me/templates/report.html and skills/explain-me/references/BUILD_GUIDE.md
//         — the skill's own report template + authoring guide substitute their {{tokens}} at
//         project RUNTIME (not scaffold time), so they ship verbatim by design. Context: the
//         files reached templates/common when the explain-me L0↔L1 mirror drift was fixed
//         (only SKILL.md propagated before, leaving a broken half-skill in projects).
// v1.2.0: graft fleet surface (ADR-0076): .mcp.json + opencode.json join JSON_MERGE_FILES
//         (project-owned MCP servers survive the union); .claude/skills/graft/** claims
//         TEMPLATE TREE SYNC before the platform-mirror rule (the skill is hand-maintained
//         outside the SSOT skills/, so sync-skills.ts can never deliver it — the verified
//         fleet-gap root cause); .codex/** is ADD_IF_MISSING (co-abap/co-safety own their
//         config.toml; the graft section is seeded only into projects lacking the file).
// v1.1.0: .env.sample reclassified PRESERVE → SYNC/ENV_SAMPLE SYNC (upgrade-project v1.23.0):
//         the upgrade path now re-delivers template env-key changes with scaffold-parity
//         country pruning applied (shared scripts/lib/env-sample-blocks.ts), so template
//         .env.sample additions reach existing projects without re-injecting pruned
//         country blocks.
// upgrade-policy.ts — Upgrade classification SSOT (2026-09-11-upgrade-policy-coverage-design.md)
// Classifies EVERY project-relative path a template can deliver. The fallback claim is
// TEMPLATE TREE SYNC (deliver by default): coverage is deny-list, not an enumeration, so a
// template file added without any governance decision still reaches existing projects.
//
// Consumers:
//   - scripts/upgrade-project.ts — the TEMPLATE TREE SYNC pass delivers every file whose
//     claim.pass === TEMPLATE_TREE_SYNC_PASS (legacy passes keep owning their classified paths).
//   - scripts/check-upgrade-coverage.ts — reports the classification matrix over the whole
//     effective template tree and gates on the strict checks (placeholders, WS-07, JSON health).
