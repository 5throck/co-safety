# Compliance Gap Analysis

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when: a new regulation is enacted or amended, a periodic compliance review is due, an audit finding references a legal requirement, management requests a gap assessment, or a new operational activity may trigger new regulatory obligations. Also invoke after any serious incident to assess whether legal obligations were met.

## Steps

1. **Regulation Identification** — Identify all applicable regulations based on the industry sector, workplace type, number of employees, and work activities. Key frameworks:
   - 산업안전보건법 (OSHA-KR) and subordinate regulations
   - 중대재해처벌법 (SAPA) — applies to workplaces with 5+ employees
   - 화학물질관리법 (Chemical Substances Control Act) — if applicable
   - 화학물질등록·평가 등에 관한 법률 (K-REACH) — if applicable (hazardous/toxic chemical management provisions formerly under 유해화학물질관리법 (TCCL), which K-REACH partially supersedes per `regulations/KR/K-REACH.yaml`)
   - Other sector-specific regulations as identified

2. **Live Regulation Verification** — Before gap analysis, verify article numbers and content are current using the `kr_safety` and `legalize_kr` MCP tools (live law lookup) rather than static indexes alone, per the compliance-agent Workflow Pattern (`agents/_shared/compliance-agent.md` §Workflow Pattern, step 2). This project has a history of mis-citations that live verification catches.

3. **Current State Assessment** — For each applicable regulation, document the current compliance state: systems in place, records available, responsible persons assigned, training completed.

4. **Gap Identification** — Compare current state against regulatory requirements. For each gap, record:
   - Regulation article and requirement
   - Current state (what exists)
   - Required state (what the law mandates)
   - Gap description
   - Risk level (Critical / Major / Minor)

5. **Corrective Action Recommendation** — For each identified gap, recommend a corrective action with estimated effort, responsible party, and target completion date. Prioritize Critical gaps (those with potential criminal liability under 중대재해처벌법) first.

6. **Gap Report** — Produce a structured gap report and save to `memory/findings/`. Present findings to the CSO for review and approval of the corrective action plan.

## Legal Notes

- 산업안전보건법 imposes duties on employers across all aspects of occupational safety and health. Violations can result in fines up to 50 million KRW or imprisonment.
- 중대재해처벌법 imposes criminal penalties when serious accidents (SAPA Article 2 thresholds) result from failure to meet safety obligations — individuals: 1년 이상 징역 또는 10억원 이하 벌금 for death cases, 7년 이하 징역 또는 1억원 이하 벌금 for injury·disease cases (Article 6); corporations face dual-liability fines up to 50억원 (death) / 10억원 (injury·disease) under the Article 7 양벌규정.
