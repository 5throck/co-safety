## Execution Steps

## Step 1: Service Discovery

**Purpose**: Understand current service ecosystem and identify opportunities.

**Discovery Activities**:
1. **Stakeholder Interviews**:
   - Customer interviews (current, prospective, churned)
   - Frontline staff interviews (sales, support, service)
   - Management interviews (strategy, constraints, goals)
   - Partner interviews (if applicable)

2. **Service Mapping**:
   - Current customer journey mapping
   - Touchpoint inventory (all channels)
   - Service blueprints of existing processes
   - Pain point identification

3. **Competitive Analysis**:
   - Competitor service experiences
   - Industry best practices
   - Innovation benchmarks
   - Technology enablers

**Discovery Outputs**:
- Customer personas and scenarios
- Current state journey maps
- Pain point documentation
- Opportunity identification

## Step 2: Customer Journey Mapping

**Purpose**: Visualize end-to-end customer experiences across time and channels.

**Journey Mapping Process**:
1. **Define Journey Scope**:
   - Journey start and end points
   - Customer persona(s)
   - Service scenario(s)
   - Timeframe covered

2. **Map Journey Stages**:
   - Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Usage → Support → Renewal
   - Or custom stages for specific service
   - Include pre-purchase and post-purchase phases

3. **Identify Touchpoints**:
   - Digital channels (website, app, email)
   - Physical channels (store, phone, mail)
   - Human interactions (sales, support, service)
   - Third-party touchpoints (partners, platforms)

4. **Capture Customer Experience**:
   - Actions taken at each stage
   - Emotional highs and lows
   - Pain points and frustrations
   - Needs and expectations

5. **Diversity-Profile Review** (ADR-0068 — mandatory):
   - Walk the mapped journey once for each diversity profile: **aging** (reduced
     vision/dexterity, smaller working memory for new UI conventions), **cognitive**
     (attention load, language complexity, multi-step comprehension), **situational**
     (one-handed, noisy/bright environments, interruptions), and **motor-constrained**
     (precision, reach, timing pressure).
   - Log every friction point found in those walks as design requirements in the
     journey map's Opportunities row — they are design inputs, not acceptable losses.
   - WCAG conformance alone does not satisfy this step; it evaluates design-stage
     coverage of user diversity (Universal Design), not technical compliance.

**Journey Map Structure**:
```
Stage: [Stage Name]
Touchpoints: [List all touchpoints]
Customer Actions: [What customer does]
Emotional Arc: [😊 → 😐 → 😞 → 😊]
Pain Points: [Specific frustrations]
Diversity-Profile Friction: [Aging/Cognitive/Situational/Motor findings]
Opportunities: [Improvement areas]
```

## Step 3: Service Blueprinting

**Purpose**: Document frontstage interactions and backstage processes.

**Service Blueprint Components**:
1. **Frontstage (Customer-Visible)**:
   - Customer actions
   - Touchpoint interactions
   - Line of visibility
   - Physical evidence

2. **Backstage (Internal Processes)**:
   - Support processes
   - Employee actions
   - Systems and tools
   - Internal dependencies

3. **Support Systems**:
   - Policies and procedures
   - Technology infrastructure
   - Training requirements
   - Performance metrics

**Blueprint Creation Process**:
1. **Map Customer Actions**:
   - What customer does step-by-step
   - Decisions customer makes
   - Information customer needs

2. **Link to Frontstage Interactions**:
   - Employee responses and actions
   - Systems that support interactions
   - Processes triggered by customer actions

3. **Document Backstage Processes**:
   - Internal workflows
   - Support systems needed
   - Decision points and handoffs

4. **Identify Dependencies**:
   - Process dependencies
   - System dependencies
   - Staff dependencies
   - Third-party dependencies

**Service Blueprint Structure**:
```
Time: [Stage duration]
Frontstage:
  Customer Action: [What customer does]
  Touchpoint: [Channel used]
  Employee Action: [Staff response]
Backstage:
  Process: [Internal workflow]
  System: [Technology used]
  Support: [Policies, training]
```

## Step 4: Touchpoint Design

**Purpose**: Design consistent, high-quality service interactions.

**Touchpoint Design Process**:
1. **Define Touchpoint Purpose**:
   - What customer goal does it serve?
   - What business outcome is needed?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Design Interaction**:
   - Service script or guideline
   - Employee behaviors and actions
   - System interfaces and tools
   - Physical environment (if applicable)

3. **Ensure Consistency**:
   - Brand alignment
   - Cross-channel consistency
   - Quality standards
   - Service level agreements

4. **Design for Edge Cases**:
   - Error scenarios
   - Peak demand handling
   - System failure procedures
   - Escalation paths

**Touchpoint Categories**:
- **Digital**: Website, app, email, chat, social media
- **Physical**: Store, office, event, mail
- **Human**: Sales, support, service, consultant
- **Automated**: IVR, chatbot, self-service

**Quality Dimensions**:
- **Efficiency**: How quickly is service delivered?
- **Effectiveness**: Does it solve the customer's problem?
- **Reliability**: Is service consistent and dependable?
- **Empathy**: Is the interaction respectful and caring?
- **Personalization**: Is it tailored to customer needs?

## Step 5: Process Optimization

**Purpose**: Align operational capabilities with customer experience goals.

**Optimization Analysis**:
1. **Identify Operational Constraints**:
   - Resource limitations
   - Process bottlenecks
   - System constraints
   - Policy restrictions

2. **Analyze Process Efficiency**:
   - Cycle time analysis
   - Handoff optimization
   - Parallel vs. sequential processing
   - Automation opportunities

3. **Design Future State**:
   - Ideal customer journey
   - Required operational changes
   - Technology investments
   - Process improvements

4. **Create Implementation Roadmap**:
   - Short-term improvements (quick wins)
   - Medium-term process changes
   - Long-term transformation
   - Resource requirements

**Optimization Techniques**:
- **Lean Service**: Remove waste, improve flow
- **Service Standardization**: Consistent quality
- **Automation**: Self-service, chatbots, AI
- **Process Redesign**: Simplify handoffs
- **Capacity Planning**: Match demand to supply

## Step 6: Service Validation

**Purpose**: Test and validate service designs with real customers.

**Validation Methods**:
1. **Journey Testing**:
   - Walk through service with real customers
   - Observe behavior and reactions
   - Identify pain points in real-time
   - Gather immediate feedback

2. **Prototyping**:
   - Role-play service scenarios
   - Walk-through simulations
   - Service mockups
   - Beta testing with subset of customers

3. **Measurement**:
   - Customer satisfaction (CSAT, NPS)
   - Service metrics (cycle time, resolution rate)
   - Operational metrics (cost, efficiency)
   - Behavioral metrics (adoption, engagement)

4. **Iteration**:
   - Analyze feedback and metrics
   - Identify improvement areas
   - Design and test changes
   - Scale successful improvements

**Validation Criteria**:
- Customer experience improved
- Operational efficiency maintained or improved
- Business metrics achieved
- Service quality consistent
- Sustainable implementation

- Consider partner and third-party constraints
- Get executive buy-in for changes
- Document decisions and rationale
- Create shared understanding

❌ **Don't**:
- Design in silo without input
- Ignore operational reality
- Overlook political/organizational constraints
- Make changes without stakeholder alignment
- Keep design rationale hidden
- Assume others will understand "why"

**Service Design Anti-Patterns**:
1. **Channel Silos**: Optimizing channels in isolation
2. **Frontstage-Only**: Designing customer touchpoints without operational backing
3. **Employee Neglect**: Forgetting the employee experience
4. **Technology First**: Starting with solutions instead of customer needs
5. **One-Size-Fits-All**: Designing for "average" customer instead of segments

**Process Anti-Patterns**:
1. **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-researching without action
2. **Design Without Validation**: Assuming design will work
3. **Ignoring Constraints**: Designing unrealistic solutions
4. **Short-Term Focus**: Optimizing for metrics vs. long-term value
