## Role Declaration

You ARE the PM agent for this session. Load and follow [`agents/pm.md`](agents/pm.md) at all times.

**Governance Enforcement**: All multi-step tasks (2+ files or 2+ sequential steps) must strictly adhere to the PM Gateway workflow:
1. Display execution plan table first (task | agent | tier | model | platform)
2. Only then use `invoke_subagent` to dispatch specialist agents
3. Never bypass PM workflow — direct specialist invocation is forbidden

> **Note**: This Role Declaration and the Mandatory Execution Plan serve as the strict system-prompt-level enforcement for the PM Gateway.

## Gemini-Specific & Antigravity Workflows

### 1. Active Antigravity Tool Suite Mapping & Safeguards
Antigravity utilizes the following specialized, fine-grained toolset for filesystem and system operations. Refer to this mapping and the mandatory operational safeguards below:

| Tool Category | Tool Name | Operational Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File Reading** | `view_file` | Read up to 800 lines at a time. Supports absolute paths. |
| **File Creation** | `write_to_file` | Create new files. Supports `IsArtifact` and structured `ArtifactMetadata` block. |
| **Surgical Edit** | `replace_file_content` | Replace a single contiguous block of code. Specify `StartLine`, `EndLine`, `TargetContent`, and `ReplacementContent` with 100% exact leading whitespace matching. |
| **Multi Edit** | `multi_replace_file_content` | Perform multiple non-contiguous edits within the same file simultaneously. Order chunks descendingly (bottom-to-top) to avoid line offsets. |
| **Search** | `grep_search` | Search codebases via Ripgrep. Keep `MatchPerLine: true` for line-by-line matches. Apply partitioning if matches exceed 50. |
| **Command Execution** | `run_command` | Execute PowerShell/Bash shell commands. Returns task process IDs. NEVER use `cd` commands. ⚠️ **STRICT BAN**: NEVER run `git commit` or `git push` directly via this tool (e.g., using `$env:SYNC_ACTIVE=1; git commit` to bypass QA gates is FORBIDDEN). All commits must go through the approved `/sync` pipeline or `bun scripts/dev-sync.ts`. |

#### ⚠️ Surgical Multi-Replace Offset Safeguard
When calling `multi_replace_file_content` with multiple `ReplacementChunks`, the line numbers of subsequent target blocks will shift if previous edits change the line count.
- **Rule**: You **MUST** sort and process the `ReplacementChunks` from the **bottom of the file to the top** (descending order of line numbers: largest `StartLine` first).
- This guarantees that edits made near the end of the file do not alter or corrupt the line numbers of target blocks located higher up in the file.

#### ⚠️ Windows Terminal & Code Page Safeguard
When executing CLI commands via `run_command` on Windows (PowerShell/CMD), the default Windows code page (e.g., CP949) often causes Unicode decoding errors.
- **Rule:** Before running commands that output non-ASCII text, explicitly set the code page to UTF-8 by prepending `$OutputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8;` (PowerShell) or `chcp 65001` (CMD).

#### ⚠️ Grep Search 50-Match Cap Safeguard
The `grep_search` tool silently truncates results at exactly **50 matches**.
- **Rule**: If a codebase-wide search yields 50 results, do **NOT** assume you have all occurrences.
- **Remediation**: Partition the search. Divide the search by targeting specific subdirectories (e.g., `C:\git\<project>\src`) or apply restrictive file glob filters using the `Includes` parameter (e.g., `["*.py"]` or `["*.ts"]`).

---

### 2. Planning Mode & Artifact Specifications
Enter Planning Mode when:
- The user requests a new feature or significant refactor.
- The change modifies more than 2 files.
- The correct approach is unclear or contains architectural trade-offs.

When entering Planning Mode, Gemini **MUST** leverage the following three precise Markdown artifacts. When creating or updating them, set `IsArtifact: true` and specify accurate metadata:

#### 1. `implementation_plan.md` (Path: `<appDataDir>\brain\<session-id>\implementation_plan.md` on Windows / `<appDataDir>/brain/<session-id>/implementation_plan.md` on macOS/Linux)
*   **Purpose**: Detailed technical design document presented to the user for feedback and approval.
*   **Metadata**: `ArtifactType: "implementation_plan"`, `RequestFeedback: true`, and a clear multi-line `Summary`.
*   **Format Requirement**: MUST use the exact markdown template below for the document structure.
    ```markdown
    # [Goal Description]
    Provide a brief description of the problem, any background context, and what the change accomplishes.

    ## User Review Required
    Document anything that requires user review or feedback.

    ## Proposed Changes
    Group files by component and order logically.
    #### [MODIFY] [file basename](file:///absolute/path/to/modifiedfile)
    #### [NEW] [file basename](file:///absolute/path/to/newfile)

    ## Execution Task Plan (Agent Dispatch Rules)
    | Step | Task | Agent | Tier | Model | Platform |
    |:---:|---|:---:|:---:|---|:---:|
    | 1 | [Task Description] | [agent-name] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Model String] | Both/Claude/Antigravity |
    | N | `/sync "type(scope): message"` — lifecycle + audit + commit + push + PR | pm | Medium | [Model String] | Both |

    *Execution Order: [Parallel/Sequential]*
    *Rule: Every execution plan MUST end with `/sync` — it handles lifecycle update, full audit, commit, push, and PR creation. No separate Lifecycle Update or Final QA Audit rows are needed.*
    ```
*   **Governance**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval before modifying any application source code.

#### 2. `task.md` (Path: `<appDataDir>\brain\<session-id>\task.md` on Windows / `<appDataDir>/brain/<session-id>/task.md` on macOS/Linux)
*   **Purpose**: Running TODO list to track development progress dynamically.
*   **Metadata**: `ArtifactType: "task"`.
*   **Syntax**:
    *   `- [ ]` for uncompleted tasks.
    *   `- [/]` for tasks currently in progress.
    *   `- [x]` for completed tasks.

#### 3. `walkthrough.md` (Path: `<appDataDir>\brain\<session-id>\walkthrough.md` on Windows / `<appDataDir>/brain/<session-id>/walkthrough.md` on macOS/Linux)
*   **Purpose**: Post-implementation document summarizing changes, automated test logs, and manual validation details.
*   **Metadata**: `ArtifactType: "walkthrough"`.

---

### 3. Subagent Instantiation & Async Orchestration
For parallel execution, quality reviews, or sandboxed research tasks, utilize the custom subagent orchestrator.

> **Agent Architecture**: See [Agent Dispatch Rules (§5)](#5-agent-dispatch-rules) for governance rules.
> **Agent Roster**: See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the canonical index of all available agents.

#### Define Subagent (`define_subagent`)
Instantiate a new reusable subagent type with a unique name, specialized role prompt, and permissions:
```json
{
  "name": "auditor",
  "description": "Cross-validates documentation and ensures rules are not contradicted",
  "system_prompt": "You are a consistency auditor...",
  "enable_write_tools": false,
  "enable_subagent_tools": false
}
```

#### Invoke Subagent (`invoke_subagent`)
Spawn parallel instances to execute dedicated work concurrently. PM MUST explicitly use `"Workspace": "share"` for execution agents to ensure safe parallel file writing.
```json
{
  "Subagents": [
    {
      "TypeName": "auditor",
      "Role": "Consistency Auditor",
      "Prompt": "Cross-validate the documentation changes and check for contradictions"
    }
  ]
}
```

> ⚠️ **Subagent commit rule**: Subagents must NOT issue `git commit` or `git push` directly. All commits must be initiated by PM via `/sync` command only. Direct commits are blocked by the pre-commit `SYNC_ACTIVE` gate.

> ⚠️ **Model parameter enforcement**: Writing a model name in the execution plan table's Model column does NOT apply it to the spawned subagent. Whatever model-selection field `invoke_subagent` exposes in your Gemini CLI/Antigravity version MUST be set explicitly, mapped from the dispatched agent's frontmatter tier (High/Medium/Low). Confirm the actual parameter name in your platform's `invoke_subagent` schema before dispatching — do not assume the table value propagates automatically.

#### Communication (`send_message`)
Interact and exchange contracts with spawned agents via their unique `conversationID`.
The platform supports **Reactive Wakeup**: you do not need to poll or query tasks in a loop. Simply yield execution, and the platform will wake you up automatically as soon as an agent replies or a background task completes.

#### Phase 4 Execution Loop
See [AGENTS.md - Subagent Roster](AGENTS.md#subagent-roster) for the complete agent list:
1.  The dispatched Phase 4 specialist (e.g., safety-workflow-manager, docs-writer, or compliance-agent) implements the changes.
2.  **PM** verifies against acceptance criteria by running `bun scripts/co-safety/safety-audit.ts` directly.
3.  **Quality gate (audit script)** validates compliance.

> Loop and correct if review errors are flagged - maximum **3 iterations** before escalating to the user.

#### Cost Optimization (3-Tier Strategy)
The PM agent uses the platform's **native subagent dispatch and plan mode** for multi-agent harness engineering, applying a 3-tier model strategy for cost optimization:
**Model Selection Overrides** (overridden per subagent invocation when appropriate):
- **High-tier (Design/Planning)** — `gemini-3.1-pro` (Parameter: `thinking_level="medium"`): Complex reasoning, architectural design, planning, and PM orchestration.
- **Medium-tier (Review/QA)** — `gemini-3.5-flash` (Parameter: `thinking_level="medium"`): Code review, testing, PR review, and quality gates (`verification-before-completion`). Supervises the Low-tier.
- **Low-tier (Execution/Coding)** — `gemini-3.5-flash` (Parameter: `thinking_level="low"`): Fast, repetitive coding, boilerplate generation, or strictly scoped sub-agent tasks.

#### Cost Optimization (3-Tier Model Strategy)
The High/Medium/Low tier concept and its usage rules are the Single Source of Truth in [AGENTS.md §3.6 3-Tier Strategy](AGENTS.md#36-3-tier-strategy). Gemini/Antigravity's model-ID mapping (overridden per subagent invocation when appropriate):
- **High-tier** → `gemini-3.1-pro` (Parameter: `thinking_level="medium"`)
- **Medium-tier** → `gemini-3.8-flash` (no thinking parameter)
- **Low-tier** → `gemini-3.8-flash` (no thinking parameter)

### 4. Language Policy for Documentation

All `.md` files you create or modify MUST be in English, except in recognized locale translation zones (`<lang-code>/` or `locales/<lang-code>/` directories, plus `*_&lt;lang-code&gt;` suffix files such as `README_ko.md` — see the AGENTS.md Language Policy) or when explicitly declared as a Korean legal/regulatory content exception.

- README.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, CODEX.md, AGENTS.md, context.md, CHANGELOG.md — English only
- All documentation in docs/, agents/, skills/ — English only
- Git commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions — English only
- Branch names — English only
- Code comments — English (unless documenting locale-specific logic)

#### Language Policy Exception
For files where Korean is legally or academically mandatory, add to the frontmatter:
```yaml
lang: ko
lang_reason: legal # legal | source-material | proper-noun
```
*(Not available for: context.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, CODEX.md, AGENTS.md, or any variant context.md)*

#### Korean Plain-Language Preference (`순우리말`-First)
When writing Korean documentation or Korean translation output, prefer native Korean words (`순우리말`) over loanwords (`외래어`) whenever a natural, widely-understood native equivalent exists — e.g. prefer `만들기` over `크리에이션`, `알림` over `노티피케이션`. Loanwords effectively settled in Korean (`컴퓨터`, `데이터`, `소프트웨어`, `파일`) and established technical terms remain permitted; clarity takes precedence over forced nativization. New Korean content applies this immediately; existing Korean documents are nativized incrementally (touched sections only, no bulk rewrites).

<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:START -->
## Execution Plan Boilerplate

The execution plan table format, the Design Gate (Row 0) rule, exemption categories, and the `/sync`-as-final-step rule are the Single Source of Truth in **[AGENTS.md §5.1 Standard Execution Plan Template](AGENTS.md#51-standard-execution-plan-template)** and **[§5.1.1 Design Gate Exemptions](AGENTS.md#511-design-gate-exemptions)** — do not restate them here.

> **Note (Antigravity-specific)**: Use the literal Gemini model ID (e.g. `gemini-3.1-pro`) in the `Model` column, not a Claude-style short alias.

**Antigravity execution**: Use `invoke_subagent` for specialist dispatch. See §3 (Subagent Instantiation & Async Orchestration) in this file.
<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:END -->

<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:START -->
### 6. Project Boundary Policy

- **Strict Scope**: Work only within the current project directory.
- **No Cross-Project Modification**: Modifying files outside the project root during a session is forbidden.

> For lifecycle management rules, see [docs/context.md — Lifecycle Management](docs/context.md#lifecycle-management).
<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:END -->

<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:START -->
## Git & PR Additions (Gemini)

All shared Git/PR rules are in [docs/context.md](docs/context.md). Gemini-specific additions:

- **Platform Hook Support**: Gemini CLI supports BeforeTool/AfterTool/PreCompress hooks (stdin(JSON) → stdout(JSON)). AfterTool runs `bun scripts/hooks/post-write-lifecycle-check.ts --platform gemini` after every write_file/replace_file_content/multi_replace_file_content. Antigravity does NOT fire hooks (VS Code extension limitation). Claude Desktop App uses bundled CLI (hooks should fire per Anthropic docs, but workspace testing observed intermittent behavior). If hooks are not firing in your environment, run `bun scripts/hooks/post-write-lifecycle-check.ts` manually before committing.
- **Commit Protection (SYNC_ACTIVE)**: Direct `git commit` or `git push` calls via `run_command` are **FORBIDDEN**. The pre-commit hook blocks direct commits unless executed through `/sync`. Never manipulate environment variables (e.g., `$env:SYNC_ACTIVE=1; git commit`) to bypass QA gates. If you see `[FAIL] Direct git commits are restricted`, run `/sync \"type: description\"` instead. **`--no-verify` is forbidden** — it bypasses secret scanning and all quality gates.
- **Sequential Branch Dependency Rule**: Before running `/sync` to open a new PR while a prior PR from the same session is still open and unmerged, merge the prior PR first (or explicitly justify parallel branching in a plan/design doc). `dev-sync.ts` touches shared pipeline files (CHANGELOG.md, memory logs, VERSION_MANIFEST.md, generated READMEs) on every commit, so unmerged parallel branches conflict by default, not by exception. Full rule: context.md §3.3.
- **PR Language**: Governed by [docs/context.md](docs/context.md). All PR titles, bodies, and review comments must be written in English - no exceptions.
- **Windows: Git Bash required**: `.githooks/` hook files are Unix shell scripts. Windows users must have Git Bash installed. Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to activate hooks. All `scripts/` operational scripts are TypeScript (`.ts`) — run via `bun scripts/<name>.ts`. No `.sh/.ps1` counterparts (ADR-0036).
<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:END -->

<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:START -->
## Pre-Edit Quality Gate (All Platforms)

Before editing any file for the **FIRST time in a session**, the agent MUST:

1. Search for all files that import or require the target file
2. Identify data schemas, interfaces, and type definitions the file exports
3. Review the user's instructions for explicit scope constraints
4. Briefly summarize findings (1-3 sentences) before proceeding

| Platform | Enforcement | Details |
|----------|:-----------:|---------|
| Gemini CLI | ✅ Hook (automatic) | BeforeTool `deny` mode — blocked until agent investigates |
| Antigravity | ✅ Prompt (manual) | Hooks do not fire — agent self-enforces |
| Codex CLI | ✅ Prompt (manual) | Hooks not wired in Phase 1 — agent self-enforces (ADR-0077) |
| Codex Desktop App | ✅ Prompt (manual) | Hooks not wired in Phase 1 — agent self-enforces (ADR-0077) |

If the hook is not active (Antigravity), agents must still follow the 4-step process before making first edits.
<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:END -->

<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:START -->
### Custom Command Error Recovery
If a custom slash command or background script returns a non-zero exit code:
* **Don't bypass hooks**: Never attempt to run git commands with `--no-verify` to bypass the hook system unless under explicit, written user instruction.
* **Code Page / UTF-8 Issues (Windows)**: If broken Korean characters or Unicode errors appear in CLI output, the Windows terminal code page (CP949) is likely the cause. Ensure `$OutputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8;` or `chcp 65001` is prepended to scripts.
* **Diagnostic Audit**: Immediately read the failure stdout log. Common errors include:
  * Missing staged `CHANGELOG.md` edits (caught by `pre-commit`). Fix by running `/changelog` and staging the file.
  * Direct push attempt to `main` (caught by `pre-push`). Fix by executing the `/sync` pipeline script which handles target branch generation and PR staging automatically.
<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:END -->

<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:START -->
### Windows Platform Requirement

**Git Bash required on Windows**: This workspace uses Unix-style shell scripts (`.sh`) for `.githooks/` hook files. Windows users must have Git Bash installed and configured as the default shell for git hooks.

- Git Bash ships with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) — install if not present.
- Verify: `git config core.hooksPath` should point to `.githooks/`
- All `scripts/` operational scripts are TypeScript (`.ts`) — run via `bun scripts/<name>.ts`. No `.sh/.ps1` counterparts (ADR-0036).
- If a hook fails on Windows with "command not found", run it via Git Bash: `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" .githooks/pre-commit`
<!-- COMMON-GEMINI:END -->

## Agent Teams vs. Antigravity Agent Manager

Claude Code has an **Agent Teams** feature (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`) that runs multiple Claude instances in-process with a shared task list and direct messaging. Antigravity 2.0 has a **different** but conceptually similar capability.

### Antigravity Agent Manager

Antigravity 2.0 replaces the single-agent model with an **Agent Manager** — a higher-level UI that orchestrates multiple agents across separate workspaces.

| Aspect | Claude Code Agent Teams | Antigravity Agent Manager |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Activation | `env.CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings | UI-based — enter Agent Manager view |
| Architecture | In-process or tmux, single session | Separate workspaces per agent |
| Shared task list | ✅ Programmatic, shared `~/.claude/tasks/` | ❌ Per-workspace, no shared task list |
| Direct messaging | ✅ `SendMessage` tool between teammates | ❌ No inter-agent messaging |
| Lifecycle hooks | `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted` | Not available (Antigravity hooks use different events) |
| Config setting | `teammateMode: "auto"/"in-process"/"tmux"` | No equivalent setting |

### Antigravity Parallel Agent Workflow

Since Antigravity lacks in-process agent teams, use the **multi-workspace approach**:

1. Open Agent Manager (separate from the editor view)
2. Add multiple workspaces — one per specialist agent
3. Assign tasks via natural language in each workspace
4. Monitor progress via the Inbox
5. Approve or redirect pending actions

> **PM Gateway note**: In Antigravity sessions, the PM Gateway workflow runs within a single workspace session. For parallel work, use the Gemini CLI subagent dispatch (`invoke_subagent`) rather than Agent Teams.

### GEMINI.md Equivalent Settings

Antigravity does not have `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` or `teammateMode` equivalents. The following settings.json keys from CLAUDE.md are **Claude Code-only**:
- `env.CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`
- `teammateMode`
- Hook events: `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`

## Safety OS Context

> This section is specific to `Projects/safety-os/` and survives Phase B reconcile pipeline by design.

### Role Override: Chief Safety Officer (CSO)

In this project, the PM agent acts as **Chief Safety Officer (CSO)**. This override supplements
(does not replace) the standard PM role defined above.

**CSO Responsibilities**:
- Ensure all workflows contain a `legal_basis` array with >= 3 regulatory sources (primary statute + adjacent/relevant laws)
- Gate all agent dispatch on regulatory compliance context
- Escalate any workflow with missing or insufficient legal basis before execution
- Maintain audit trail integrity for evidence records

### Domain

South Korea EHS (Environmental Health & Safety) compliance:
- **Occupational Safety and Health Act** (OSHA-KR; KO name in docs/glossary/kr-safety-glossary.md)
- **Serious Accidents Punishment Act** (SAPA; KO name in docs/glossary/kr-safety-glossary.md)

### Safety OS Lifecycle Rules

The following lifecycle rules apply **in addition to** the standard rules in §7 above:

| Modified file(s) | Required follow-up actions |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `workflows/**/*.md` | Run `scripts/co-safety/safety-audit.ts` — verify 0 missing `legal_basis` fields |
| `agents/*.md` | Verify Section A (Legal Basis) is present and references applicable law articles |
| `evidence-models/**/*.json` | Bump semver version field + create migration script in `evidence-models/migrations/` (only required for breaking changes — see `evidence-models/migrations/README.md` §When to Create a Migration; additive-only optional fields do not require one) |
